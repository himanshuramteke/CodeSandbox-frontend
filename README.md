### How to create and run a react project ?
Step-1: Create a react project using create button on the landing page.After creating the project it will redirect you to Project-Playground page.

Step-2: In Project-Playground page change directory to sandbox(`cd sandbox`) using custom terminal(xterm).

Step-3: After that run `npm install` to install all the dependencies(node_modules). 

Step-4: Run the project using command `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` .

Step-5: Click on the `Load Browser` Button of the Browser window for live preview of the project.
